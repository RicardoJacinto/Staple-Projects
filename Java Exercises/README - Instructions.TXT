PROJECT TITLE: Java Exercices
VERSION or DATE: v0.1 2016
AUTHORS: Ricardo Jacinto
USER INSTRUCTIONS: To run this project, you'll need a program like BlueJ to run the java virtual machine. 
Press the “package.bluej” to execute the program. Run “circTest” and “SegTest” by right clicking on them and selecting “void main(String[] args)”.
This in turn will, run the terminal and display the outputs.
PORPUSE OF PROJECT: This project consists in three simple classes (Point, Circle and Segment) with the intent of demonstrating my knowledge in: 
•	Maths;
•	Oriented Object Programming; 
•	Class abstraction and capsule oriented programming; 
•	Creation and interaction with simple classes;

All classes are secured and locked and can’t be tempered from the outside, creating more security and stability. 
Get classes only return values and when returning objects, a clone is always sent (instead of the real object) to prevent loss of control and ensure that the same address isn’t shared by multiple instances. 
Set classes only modify internal variables, again preventing loss of control and providing modularity.
